Introduction
------------

*Software engineer with strong people and management skills, seeking a lead developer or
engineering manager role.*

As an engineer I care deeply about quality and precision, not only at the code level but throughout
the product. I balance attention to detail with a drive to ship, because a product is only as good
as its usefulness to actual people. I enjoy creating lucid user experiences and designing robust
software architectures.

As a team leader I bring empathy, solidity, and clarity of communication. I enjoy optimizing
processes and refining infrastructure so teams are faced with minimal repetitive load and can focus
on high-flying creativity.

I seek a vibrant environment of innovation, a strong team practicing Agile methodologies, and a
culture of excellence. It is more than a day job, it is a platform to make a meaningful contribution
at a global scale.
